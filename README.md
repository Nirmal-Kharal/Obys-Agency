obys.agency (Award-Winning Website)

This project is a recreation of the award-winning website "obys.agency," developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GSAP, and Locomotive Scroll.
It's my final project for the "Frontend Domination" course by Sherians Coding School. 
Working on this project has provided me with in-depth knowledge of real-world development processes and given me a fresh perspective on web development. 
The official domain of the website is obys.agency. Built with passion and dedication, this project was both challenging and rewarding to complete.
